A set of tools facilitating interactions between Google Keep Notes, and a local xlsx file. Bodyweights2Calc retrieves bodyweights from Google Keep and writes them to an xlsx file. Keep2Calc does the same with workouts. KeepPruner deletes notes from Google Keep. For more details, consult their README files. 

Before using any of these programs, please set paths in utilities/params.py

I suggest testing each program before trusting it.

Some guidance may be provided in each folder's README, but they are approximations (as the codebase changes), and should not be too heavily relied on.
