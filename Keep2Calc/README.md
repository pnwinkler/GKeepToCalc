A personal project, to transfer workouts from Google Keep to my local file. 

This program reads notes from a Google Keep account, filters notes matching a particular format (i.e. they're workout notes), re-formats them on the local machine, then writes them to the correct date cell of the target spreadsheet. 

Instructions under "Wiki" tab.
