This will find the Google Keep note matching a specified format, like this:
"80.1, 80.3, 80.2, 81,"
where each number indicates the logger's bodyweight on that day.

It will then write these bodyweights to the cell neighboring the date on which that measurement was taken. Precautions will be taken: for example, if there are too few or too many bodyweights provided, the user will prompted to insert or delete a measurement where plausible. These changes will then be saved. Once complete, the program will tidy up, removing all but the leading measurement from the Google Keep note. Finally, it will tidy up after itself, leaving only 1 measurement in that Keep note (by which to identify it again next execution).
