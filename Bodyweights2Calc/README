This will find the Google Keep note matching a specified format, like this:
"80.1, 80.3, 80.2, 81,"
where each number indicates the logger's bodyweight on that day.

It will then write these bodyweights to the cell neighboring the date on which that measurement was taken. Precautions will be taken: for example, if there are too few or too many bodyweights provided, the user will prompted to insert or delete a measurement. These changes will then be written to a local xlsx file. Once complete, the program will tidy up, removing all but the last X measurements from the Google Keep note (where X is specified by the history_length parameter).
