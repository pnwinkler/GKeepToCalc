An as-yet-unfinished program. This will find the Google Keep note matching a specified format, like this:
"80.1, 80.3, 80.2, 81"
where each number indicates that day's bodyweight. It will then write these bodyweights to the cell neighboring the date on which that measurement was taken. Precautions will be taken: for example, if there are too few or too many bodyweights provided, the user will prompted, and asked to insert or delete a weight where plausible. Once complete, the program will remove all but the leading measurement from the Google Keep note.
